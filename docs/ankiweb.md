# Usage

Access the menu from **Tools -> Configure Review Feedback** or directly edit the JSON in **Tools -> Add-ons -> Review Feedback -> Config**.

The first five pages define the HTML and CSS injected when a review is passed. Content in the "all" tab is included with every review. The "advanced" tab can be used to configure the injection ID, duration, and location of the HTML.
